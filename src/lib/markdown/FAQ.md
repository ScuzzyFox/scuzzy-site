## Site Questions

## Commissions Quesitons

**Q: I requested a commission first, but I didn't get a slot?**

_A: Commissions are not first-come, first-serve. Commissions are difficult for me to execute, even moreso if I don't really like the idea. As a result, I select commissions I like so I can make sure both the client and I are happy! This might mean I won't take your idea. Please continue to resubmit as I open for commissions OR change your idea to be more in-line with the things I like drawing._
