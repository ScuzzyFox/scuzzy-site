# Furry Commissions Terms of Service

### Introduction

I can offer a range of commission types from telegram stickers and discord emojis, to animations and badges. If you order a commission you agree to the Terms of Service laid out here.

### Process

Commissions are normally obtained by submitting a form, talking to me, or ordering one online. I retain the sole discretion at either charging you up front prior to starting work on the commission, or after a sketch is completed and approved by you. The payment timing may vary depending on the type of commission or may change depending on financial needs.

### Payment

When the time comes to pay, payment must be made in full as priced on the invoice in order for work to continue (or start). Partial payments may be allowed on the invoice sometimes but will still require you to complete the full payment before work on your order continues.

### Rights

Once your commission is complete, you agree that I, scuzzyfox, retain the entire credit/copyright to the piece (unless piece is a collaboration effort, in which the contributing artists will share credit/copyright). As a result, you may not under any other circumstances claim to have drawn or created the art purchased from me. You retain rights to your character and you may publish the piece on your personal pages.

Upon publishing your commission to public spaces (e.g. twitter, Facebook, telegram/discord channel), you are NOT required to explicitly credit scuzzyfox by linking or mentioning my name. You are allowed to “crop” images to fit profile pictures, to omit contentious content, or to call attention to an area of the piece. Cropping is not allowed for the explicit purpose of leaving the scuzzyfox signature out and the signature may not be censored out by you. If the piece ends up cropped on social media and my signature just happens to be out of frame, that is allowed as long as the intent is not to steal my art or omit credit. You are allowed to censor or crop other parts of the piece as you see fit.

Modification of your piece is allowed as described above, in addition to “photoshopping”, masking, trimming, blending, or cutting out pieces of the art to fit website banners, profile page banners, profile pictures, to create your own animations of the piece, to make memes, or to make telegram/discord stickers. Other modifications are allowed by you as long as you are not claiming to have drawn the original content.

I retain the full rights to publish your commission on any platform with credit to your characters/account name. You agree that your commission may be used as part of my advertising efforts and as a result your commission depicting your character may appear in my banners, advertisements, videos and other content.

### Refunds

Refunds for completely finished commissions are not allowed. A partial refund in the middle of the commission process is possible, however you will receive a smaller portion of a refund the further along the commission is to being completed (the range being 100% refund for no work completed and 0% refund for work fully completed). As soon as you know you need a refund, contact [scuzzyfox@gmail.com](mailto:scuzzyfox@gmail.com '‌') or check the [contact](/contact) page to get in touch for a refund.
